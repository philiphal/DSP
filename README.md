Used to display simple DSP techniques that are used in basic signal processing.

    - Simple compound sinusoidal signal generation.
    - Addition of DC offset and Gaussian noise
    - Plot signal in time and frequency domain.
    - Filter signal using a 4th order Elliptic.
    - Plot filter's amplitude response.
    - Replot signal to verify the effects of signal filter in time and frequency domain.
